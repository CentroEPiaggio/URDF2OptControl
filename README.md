# URDF2OptControl
URDF2OptControl is a framework for robot optimal control with a very simple Python API. Based on symbolical differentiation and multiple-shooting, the tool returns a control sequence that minimizes a custom cost function, according to the equations of motion. These are automatically and effortlessly loaded from a URDF file, together with a proper modelization of the dynamics of Serial Elastic Actuators (SEAs), if requested.
